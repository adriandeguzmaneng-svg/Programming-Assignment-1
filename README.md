Problem #1
For the Alphabet Soup Problem, i first turned the string into a list of elements of letters using the list() command and arranged the list into an alphabetical order using the sort() command. Lastly i used the the join() command to turn the list of elements of letters back into a single string.

Problem #2
For the Emoticon Problem, i used the if-else conditional statement in which i checked first if the statement has the specific words to turn into an emoticon using the said conditional statement then replaced the word with the emoticon using the replace command

Problem #3
For the unpacking list problem, i first displayed the 1st element, after that i stored the last element into a variable then proceeded to delete the first and the last element so that the element that will be left is the middle elements. With this i displayed the middle elements then displayed the valiable that contained the last element.
