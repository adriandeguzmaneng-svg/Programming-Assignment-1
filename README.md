Problem #1 - Alphabet Soup Problem
For the Alphabet Soup Problem, I first created na function that turns the string into a list of elements of letters using the "list()" command and arranged the list into an alphabetical order using the "sort()" command. Lastly i used the the "join()" command in the function to turn the list of elements of letters back into a single string then the function will return the alphabetically ordered string

Problem #2 - Emoticon Problem
For the Emoticon Problem, I created a function which has an if-else conditional statement in which checks first if the statement has the specific words to turn into an emoticon using the said conditional statement "if" and "elif" then if that sentence has that specific word, it will replace the word with the emoticon using the replace command.If the sentence dont have the specific words to turn into an emoticon, it will pass through the fucntion without changing anything using the "else" function on the last line of the condition. the function will end with the sentence returning with or without changes to it. 

Problem #3
For the unpacking list problem, i first displayed the 1st element using the command "print(lst[0])", after that i stored the last element into a variable using the code "last = lst[-1]" since the negative index moves backward thus moving once backward results to the last element in the array.I then proceeded to delete the first and the last element using the "del()" code so that the element that will be left is the middle elements. With this i displayed the whole array since the only thing left is the middle elements and proccedded to print the last element that is stored in a variable.
